I had an assignment to make a TicTacToe app for my android development course and it required just a User Interface and a single player mode. After completing the basics, I implemented Artificial Intelligence and multiple player mode. The artificial intelligence enabled Android OS to first analyze the situation and check if android can complete a sequence, that function was called and then android checked to see if the opposite player can complete the sequence in his/her next try and if he can the function blocks the sequence, that function was called defense and then if none of the above situation takes place then android just places the X or the O anywhere on the game board. I received 5 bonus marks for my work and my app was presented in class by the teacher.
